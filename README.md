## Why am I even doing this

As a valued member of the Gen Z community, the time has come to take action. I have had enough. 

My impatience and the fact that I have the attention span of a goldfish have largely contributed to this. I cannot waste time looking for music recommendations that are *sheit*. 

I am determined to help my fellow GenZ-ers in their search for top-tier music - and above all BANGER recommendations. Let's do this. 


:radioactive: TRIGGER WARNING :radioactive:

Please do not attempt to get a recommendation for any of the songs included in the albums listed below:

- Rumours by Fleetwood Mac (1977)
- Random Access Memories by Daft Punk (2013)
- Hunky Dory by David Bowie (1971)

Their elevated musical composition and established superiority makes it *super hard* to find anything remotely similar. My ~~almost~~ GOD-like programming skills unfortunately could not overcome this.
